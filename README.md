# Glitch_Heaven
Complete rewrite of my Glitch-Based Videogame that you can find in the
"The_Glitch" repository.

#### Status: Prototyping

### Objective of the game
Get to the exit door of the level, using some hidden glitches that
have been volountarily inserted.
Further in the game, some glitches will make the user experience harder
and more challenging.

### Glitches Implemented:
- **Wall Climb Glitch:** if you collide with a wall and keep colliding, you'll find yourself climbing the wall
- **Multiple jump Glitch:** you can jump countless times in the air.
- **High Jump Glitch:** Each jump is twice as high
- **Feather Falling glitch:** You fall at half the normal speed
- **Gravity glitch:** instead of jumping you reverse gravity.


### Glitches Planned:
- **Sticky Ceiling glitch:** if you jump and hit the ceiling, you'll stick there till you press "down arrow"
- **Invincibility Glitch:** you don't die to obstacles.
- **Dead bodies Glitch:** when you die your dead body won't despawn and you can use it as a platform.
- **Bouncy Spikes glitch:** Spikes don't kill you, they make you bounce
- **Hovering glitch:** If you keep the jump button pressed you'll keep going up, like you were flying.
- **Ledge Glitch:** if you go over a ledge, you don't fall. In order to fall you need to jump.
- **Invert-o-glitch**: Ground kills you, obstacles don't.
- **Clipping glitch**: You can glitch through certain walls
- **Clip-on-command glitch**: Pressing down arrow makes you go through the platform you're standing on
- **Solid Help Glitch**: The help text will behave like a temporary platform

### Other info:
This Game uses Richard Jones's TMX Library to load maps.
